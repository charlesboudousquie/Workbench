\brief      This is a data structure that keeps track of an agent's state within
            an instance of a BehaviorTree.

    // NOTE:
    // We want multiple agents to use the exact same tree. 
    // What I mean by that is that if multiple agents (like a "Guard" or 
    // "Soldier") use the exact same tree, then ideally only 1 instanciation of 
    // that tree would be in memory.
    // But at the same time the agent need to remember what they are
    // doing aka their state. 
    // So if multiple agents use the exact same tree then they CANNOT store 
    // their state in the tree.
    // Thus they should store their state inside their own personal blackboard.
    // So then one may ask "How do we keep track of where exactly this
    // agent is inside the tree?".
    // This is where the "Task" comes in. 
    // It keeps track of what agent it corresponds to, AND keeps track of where 
    // in the tree the agent last left off.

    // If you are wondering why the childIndices and phases are stacks,
    // it is due to the fact that an Agent MUST remember its previous
    // states higher up in the tree. Especially since the nodes in the
    // tree are NOT allowed to store state. The nodes in the Behavior Tree
    // are essentially glorified instructions through which an agent acts upon.

    // is currently working with a tree or not

    // are operating on.

    // clears all history accumulated
    void ClearHistory();

    // prepare new slot in history so we can record our state with the new node

    // with (potentially null if we are a leaf node).
    Behavior* childBehavior;

    // last known result of operation
    BehaviorResult result;

    // NOTE: 
    // Since traversing a Behavior Tree is similar to depth
    // first search, we will be using stacks to remember
    // our state in higher nodes. This is helpful when an agent
    // finishes a particular behavior and needs to remember
    // what its last state was in the parent node.

    // history of states throughout while traversing the tree
