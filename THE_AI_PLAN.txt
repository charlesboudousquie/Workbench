THE PLAN



What A squad has
{
    
    Squad Rings
    
}

When Unit is fighting
{
    
    For Enemy and Minions:
        All units must go into ATTACK MODE.
        What units to attack and how are up 
        to the Behavior Trees!
        
    For minions:
        If player commands minions to new target then
        they MUST rejoinFormation.
    
}


Enemies
{
    Only move squad forward when no unit is engaged.
    
    Squad is destroyed if no units are left alive.
    
    When Enemy unit encounters a player or minion it will immediately
    disengage from the squad and attack IF it is in RANGE.
